## Greatest common factor(GCF)

- Using prime factorization to find the GCF

```math
36=2×2×3×3
48=2×2×2×2×3
```

the prime factors 2, 2, 3 in common, multiply these prime factors: 2 × 2 × 3 = 12

GCF(36, 48)=12

- Using Euclid's algorithm to find the GCF  

1. Divide the larger number by the smaller number. If the remainder is 0, the divisor is the GCF. If not continue to the next step.
2. Divide the smaller number (the previous divisor) by the remainder. If the new remainder is 0, the divisor is the GCF.
3. Continue the process of dividing the previous divisor by the remainder until there is no remainder. The divisor that results in a remainder of 0 is the GCF of the original two numbers

288/144=2...60 114/60=1...54 60/54=1...6 54/6=9...0

GCF(114, 288)=6

## Least common multiple(LCM)

## Golden ratio

a/b = (a + b)/a = c

c²-c-1=0  c 约 1.618

## Euler's Theorem

Faces + Vertices - Edges = 2
